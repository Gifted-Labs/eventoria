/**
 * The {@code Venue} entity represents a physical location where events are held.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed as an entity (as opposed to an embeddable) because venues can be shared
 * across multiple events and event organizers. Making Venue an entity allows for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Reusability:</b> Popular venues can be centrally maintained and referenced by many events,
 *       reducing data duplication.</li>
 *   <li><b>Consistency:</b> Updating a venue's information (e.g., address or geolocation) is easier
 *       because the change propagates to all associated events.</li>
 *   <li><b>User Convenience:</b> Event organizers can select a popular venue from a searchable list.
 *       Once selected, the venue’s details (address, geolocation, and name) are auto-populated, streamlining
 *       the event creation process.</li>
 *   <li><b>Extensibility:</b> The entity can later be expanded with additional attributes like reviews,
 *       capacity, or pricing without changing the Event entity. This keeps the model flexible for future
 *       enhancements.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code Venue} entity uses embedded objects for address and geolocation details. This design
 * encapsulates related data in a clean, maintainable way while avoiding unnecessary table joins for these
 * value objects. In our relational schema, Venue is stored in its own table and is related to Event via
 * a foreign key. This approach strikes a balance between performance and data integrity.</p>
 *
 * <p>The recommended use-case is as follows:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If an event organizer selects a popular, pre-existing venue from the list, the system references
 *       the existing record and auto-fills the venue details on the Event form.</li>
 *   <li>If a venue is not in the popular list, the organizer can create a custom venue entry by providing
 *       all necessary details.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example Usage:</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Venue venue = Venue.builder()
 *     .name("Downtown Convention Center")
 *     .address(new Address("123 Main St", "Metropolis", "StateName", "CountryName", "12345"))
 *     .geolocation(new Geolocation(12.345678, 98.765432))
 *     .build();
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
